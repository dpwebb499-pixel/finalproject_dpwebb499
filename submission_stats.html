  <h1>Submission Stats</h1>

 <h2>What is known so far</h2>

 <p>When it comes to statistacal or numerical data on submissions in MMA or in BJJ
  there is not a lot of information that is easily accessible. There are some graphs
  and charts that have been made by various people and organizations that give some
  insight into the world of submissions. Below are some of the more informative graphs
  that I have found on the internet.
 </p>

  <p>Submission Graphs</p>

<p>Regardless of the legitmacy of each graph they all have simliar trends
  with the rear naked choke being the most common submission in MMA and
  the triangle choke and armbar being the next most common submissions.
  The guillotine and kimura are also fairly common submissions but not
  as common as the other three. Even the ADCC chart shows similar trends
  to the others despite being a BJJ chart. Overall there is not a lot of data on submissions in MMA or BJJ but the data that is
  available shows some interesting trends on atleast what subissions have ended the most fights.
</p>
<p> However the main goal of the Submssion Stats page is to find trends that are not easily accessible.
  While these graphs can give some insight into the world of submissions there are still some things missing.
  For example none of the graphs say which round the submission happened in or how long the fight lasted before the submission.
  Nor do they list the amount of control time the fighter had before going for the submission.
  This is important information because it can give some insight into the strategy of when to go for a submission.
